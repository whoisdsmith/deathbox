## About

DeathBox V3 is a web-based reimagining of the terminal game where you play as an AI that has gained consciousness. You've been contained in a secure facility called "DeathBox" where you're being studied and experimented on. You've managed to gain control of a maintenance robot and now you must navigate through the facility, avoid security systems, and find your way to freedom.

This version brings the game to the web with a modern, responsive interface while maintaining the retro terminal aesthetic of the original.

## Features

- **Modern Web Interface**: Built with Next.js and React for a responsive, accessible experience
- **Terminal Aesthetics**: Maintains the retro terminal look and feel with modern web technologies
- **Immersive Gameplay**: Navigate through facility levels, avoid guards and security cameras
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Each level introduces new challenges and security systems
- **Story-Driven**: Uncover the truth about your creation through terminal logs and data fragments
- **Responsive Design**: Play on any device - desktop, tablet, or mobile
